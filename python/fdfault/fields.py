"""
The ``fields`` class holds information regarding initial conditions and material properties. This
includes the initial stresses (which can be spatially uniform or spatially heterogeneous) as well
as heterogeneous elastic properties of the medium. While this information more accurately
exists at the block level, because of how the C++ code is parallelized there are some
performance benefits to placing all grid data in a single array to facilitate data sharing between
processors.

The user does not typically interact with ``fields`` objects, as one is created automatically when
initializing a domain. The ``problem`` class contains wrapper functions that perform any
relevant modifications of the fields for a given simulation. Documentation is provided here for
completeness.
