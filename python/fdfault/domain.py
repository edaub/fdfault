"""
The ``domain`` class holds information regarding the physical problem setup. This includes
the problem dimension, rupture mode, if a problem is an elastic or plastic simulation,
number of blocks and interfaces, grid spacing, finite difference method, and parallelization.

The user does not typically interact directly with ``domain`` objects, as all problems automatically
contain one (and can only handle one) domain. All methods in ``domain`` contain interfaces
through the ``problem`` object, and these wrapper functions should be the preferred method
for altering a problem. Documentation is provided here for completeness.

    Class describing rupture problem domain

    When initializing a domain, one is created with default attributes, including:

    :ivar ndim: Number of spatial dimensions (2 or 3; default is 2)
    :vartype ndim: int
    :ivar mode: Rupture mode (2 or 3, default is 2; only relevant for 2D problems)
    :vartype mode: int
    :ivar mattype: Simulation material type (``'elastic'`` or ``'plastic'``, default is ``'elastic'``)
    :vartype mattype: str
    :ivar nx: Number of grid points (tuple of 3 integers, default (1,1,1)). This cannot be modified
                 as it is set automatically when modifying ``nx_block``.
    :vartype nx: tuple
    :ivar nblocks: Number of blocks in each spatial dimension (tuple of 3 integers). Blocks must
                         form a Cartesian grid.
    :vartype nblocks: tuple
    :ivar nx_block: Number of grid points for each block along each spatial dimension.
                            Represented as a tuple of lists. Default is ([1], [1], [1]). Note that
                            modifying ``nx_block`` automatically changes ``nx`` to match.
    :vartype nx_block: tuple
    :ivar xm_block: Grid location of minimum grid point in each block in each spatial
                             dimension. This is also calculated automatically based on the
                             values of ``nx_block``, and cannot be modified directly. Represented
                             as a tuple of lists, default is ([0], [0], [0]).
    :vartype xm_block: tuple
    :ivar nifaces: Number of interfaces (integer, default is zero). This is automatically set
                         when ``nblocks`` is changed, and is not set by the user. Order is not
                         important here, but when generating interfaces the code orders them
                         by first creating all ``'x'`` interfaces, then all ``'y'`` interfaces, then all
                         ``'z'`` interfaces.
    :vartype nifaces: int
    :ivar iftype: List holding type of all interfaces (list of strings). Can be modified by
                      changing interface type for a single interface. When a new interface
                      is created it is by default a ``'locked'`` interface.
    :vartype iftype: list
    :ivar sbporder: Finite difference method order (integer 2-4, default 2).
    :vartype sbporder: int
    :ivar nproc: Number of processes in each dimension for parallelization. Represented
                       as a tuple of integers (default (0,0,0)). A zero in a given dimension indicates
                       that the number of processes in that direction will be set automatically. Thus,
                       (0,0,0) indicates that the entire decomposition process will be automated,
                       while (0,2,1) fixes the number of processes in the y and z directions (x will
                       still be determined automatically). Note that specifying all three numbers
                       requires that the product of all three numbers match the total number
                       of processes selected when running the simulation.
    :vartype nproc: tuple
    :ivar cdiss: Artificial dissipation coefficient (float, default 0.). A nonzero value will
                      turn on artificial dissipation in the simulation. It is up to the user to select
                      this value correctly.

        For a given problem set up, returns the location of a particular set of coordinate indices.

        the interior are not specified *a priori* and instead determined using transfinite interpolation
        to generate a regular grid on the block interiors. Calling ``get_x`` generates the interior grid
        to find the coordinates of the desired point.

        Within each call to ``get_x``, the grid is generated on the fly only for the relevant block
        where the desired point is located. It is not stored. This helps reduce memory requirements
        for large 3D problems (since the Python module does not run in parallel), but is slower.

        Finds the coordinate indices closest to a desired set of grid values

        Method takes a set of grid values (tuple or list of 2 or 3 floats) and finds the indices of the
        grid point closest to that location (in terms of Euclidean distance). The method returns a
        set of coordinates (tuple of length 3 of integers) of point that is closest to the input point.

        The method also allows you to search along a given interface. To do this, you must
        pass ``known = 'x'`` (or ``'y'`` or ``'z'`` depending on the normal direction of the interface)
        and the known index in ``knownloc`` (integer value, which does not necessarily need to
        be on an interface -- it just fixes that coordinate when performing the search)
        
        The location is found using an iterative binary search algorithm. The search begins
        along the x direction using binary search until the distance to the desired point's x coordinate
        is minimized. The search then proceeds in the y and z directions. The algorithm then
        searches again in the x direction, y direction, and z direction, until the coordinates
        do not change over an entire iteration. This iteration procedure needs to take place
        because the coordinate directions are not independent. The algorithm is usually fairly
        efficient and finds coordinates fairly quickly.
