The main class used for creating problems is the ``problem`` class. ``problem`` holds all relevant
variables and classes needed to specify a simulation, and provides interfaces to automatically
create the necessary classes when modifying the simulation. The class also contains methods
for searching the grids that will be generated in a simulation in order to find specific points
where output is desired. After the simulation is set up, it also has a method to write all information
to file when complete.

    Class describing a dynamic rupture problem.

    This is the main class used in the python module. The problem class holds all relevant
    information for setting up the simulation, and any modifications to a problem should be
    done with the included interfaces.

    To create a problem, a problem name (string) is required to initialize an instance of ``problem``

    >>> import fdfault
    >>> p = fdfault.problem('myproblem')

    This will initialize a problem with the default attributes. This includes the following:

    :ivar name: Problem name (string, must be provided when initializing)
    :vartype name: str
    :ivar datadir: Data directory where output will be saved (default is 'data/')
    :vartype datadir: str

    :vartype nt: int
    :ivar dt: Time step size (default is 0.)
    :vartype dt: float
    :ivar ttot: Total simulation time (default is 0.)
    :vartype ttot: float
    :ivar cfl: Courant ratio (dt * wave speed / dx, must be less than 1., default 0.)
    :vartype cfl: float
    :ivar ninfo: Frequency at which information is printed to the terminal during a simulation
                     (default 10)

    :ivar rkorder: Order of accuracy of time integration (default is 1)

                         using the methods below.

    :ivar outputlist: Initializing a problem creates an empty output list. To create output items, add
                        them to the list using the appropriate method.
    :vartype outputlist: list
    :ivar frt: A new problem contains a front with output turned off. To turn on front output, use
                     the appropriate method.
    :vartype frt: ~fdfault.front

    The four variables related to the time step provide several ways to set the time step. You
    can set the time step using any pair of the variables *except* the time step and the Courant
    ratio. If you provide more than two, the code defaults to the total time and either the time
    step or the Courant ratio if the time step is not provided.

    Use the methods described below to modify the simulation. When the problem is fully set-up,
    you can write the result to file

    >>> p.write_output()

    This will create the file ``myproblem.in`` in the current directory as well as any necessary
    binary files.
